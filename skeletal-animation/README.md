# Skeletal Animation Project – Godot 4

This project was created for my 2D Animation module and demonstrates the use of skeletal animation, bone rigging, and weight painting in Godot 4. The character is a stylized skeleton with a small touch of blue and includes two animation cycles: Idle and Walk.

---

## Project Overview

- Designed a 2D character with distinct body parts for skeletal animation  
- Rigged the character using Godot’s bone system  
- Applied weight painting for smooth mesh deformation  
- Created two animations:  
  - Idle  
  - Walk Cycle  
- Implemented input controls in Godot to switch between animations

---

## Features

- Minimum of five bones used to control the character  
- Both animations loop cleanly  
- Smooth deformation achieved through weight painting  
- Walk cycle is at least one second in length  
- Fully working Godot 4 project included in this repository

## Controls

Spacebar – Switch between Idle and Walk animations  
(If your input is different, update this section.)

## How to Run

1. Open Godot 4  
2. Click "Import"  
3. Select the `project.godot` file from this repository  
4. Run the main scene
